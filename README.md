# Inventory-App

The requirements for this app consisted of providing a combination of functional programming and cohesive UI. The app aimed to help users by providing a digital environment that stores data and organizes it under different categories. This was accomplished by designing simple screens with features that benefit the user 
in different ways, and simple design choices that makes for easy use. Some of these features included: the ability to add an item, the ability to add a task, the ability to categorize items, and other helpful features. My design was successful due to the simplicity of the features at hand. Keeping simplicity on an app
makes for a greater user traffic and usage. My UI designs kept users in mind due to the mentality behind them. Keeping a user-focused mentality helps developers understand how the user will interact with the app, what to expect, and how can they facilitate other aspects. 

Coding the app needed a similar approach as its design. The main challange was to match my coding skills and resources to its design plan. Having free-range designing an app can cause over-promising features and design choices, if there's no careful consideration beforehand. My strategy was to focus on its main fucntionality
features before coding other non-essential aspects of the program. This strategy can benefit future projects because users tend to focus on the app's main functionality features before interacting with others, leaving room for better resources and time management on its development cycle.

Testing the code is one of the most important phases on a development cycle. Testing this specific app had its challenges due to its different testing practices that were conducted. Not only I had to test that the program was saving data correctly, but also I had to ensure that it was separated under their different categories.
Testing is important to ensure that the program functions as it should, which led to changes on the main code because of it. This phase can help developers reveal other coding paths that can benefit the program and enhance the experience. 

In this specific development cycle, innovation played a big part on the final product. Fully replicating an existing application not only makes your application "dissapear" between other similar apps, but can also attract legal copyright issues. To avoid these issues, your application needs some innovation to stand out from 
similar apps. In my project, its innovation came with the feature of adding and managing custom tasks on the same app that manages inventory, as they are typically separated between different apps. This small innovative decision makes this application unique. 

After completing this app, I found that designing and innovation was my strongest skill in its development. Coding the different aspects of its desing was challenging due to the magnitude of the different features, design choices, and innovative aspects that I aimed to accomplish on the final product. A valuable lesson 
that I've learned is to balance these creative decisions, as our client expects a comfortable UI desing with seemless functionality. This kind of mindset will be crucial moving foward with future projects.
